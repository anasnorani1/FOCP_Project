1. Project Overview
Title: Spaceship Game
Description:
The Spaceship Game is a 2D action-packed shooting game developed using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) framework. The player controls a spaceship that navigates across the screen, shooting bullets to destroy waves of alien enemies while avoiding enemy fire. The game features a progression system, immersive sound effects, and shields to absorb damage. Players can enhance their experience by progressing through difficulty levels that introduce more enemies and challenging gameplay. The ultimate goal is to survive as long as possible while earning points.

•	Spaceship Controls: 
o	Use the left and right arrow keys to move the spaceship horizontally across the screen.
o	Press the Spacebar to fire bullets at the enemies above.
On-Screen Information
During gameplay, the following stats are always displayed:
•	Current Score: Reflects the points earned by destroying enemies.
•	High Score: Tracks the highest score ever achieved.
•	Lives: Shows the number of remaining lives. Each time the spaceship is hit by an enemy bullet, a life is lost.
________________________________________
Game Over
The game ends when all lives are lost. After the game over, a Game Over Screen appears, displaying:
•	Player’s Score: The total score achieved in the session.

3.Detailed Flowchart:










Flowchart Steps with Technical Details:

1. Game Initialization:
•	Purpose: Initialize all required game elements and prepare the game loop.
•	Details:
o	Set up the window using sf::RenderWindow with desired width and height.
o	Load resources (textures, fonts, sounds) using sf::Texture, sf::Font, and sf::SoundBuffer.
o	Initialize entities: player spaceship, enemies, bullets, boundaries, score, and lives.
2. Input Handling:
•	Purpose: Process user input to control the player spaceship and shooting.
•	Details:
o	Use sf::Keyboard::isKeyPressed() to detect key presses:
	Arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) for movement.
	Spacebar (Space) to fire bullets.
o	Store bullets fired by the player in a vector (e.g., std::vector<sf::CircleShape>).
3. Update Game Entities:
•	Purpose: Update the position and states of all game elements.
•	Details:
o	Player: Move based on input and ensure it stays within the window boundary.
	Use an sf::FloatRect for boundaries to restrict movement.
o	Enemies: Move randomly or in a predefined pattern. If near the player, fire bullets straight down.
	Store bullets fired by enemies in a separate vector.
o	Bullets:
	Update positions (player bullets move upward, enemy bullets downward).
	Remove bullets if they exit the screen using erase-remove idiom.
	Data Structures: Vectors are used to store bullets for both the player and enemies.
o	Collision Detection:
	Check if:
	Player bullets collide with enemies.
	Enemy bullets collide with the player.
	Use sf::FloatRect::intersects() for collision detection.
	On collision:
	Remove the collided entity (e.g., enemy or bullet).
	Update score or lives.
4. Rendering:
•	Purpose: Draw all updated game entities onto the screen.
•	Details:
o	Use sf::RenderWindow::clear() to clear the window at the beginning of each frame.
o	Draw each entity:
	Player spaceship (sf::Sprite or sf::ConvexShape).
	Enemies (sf::RectangleShape).
	Bullets (sf::CircleShape).
	Score and lives (sf::Text).
o	Use sf::RenderWindow::display() to present the updated frame.
5. Collision Checking:
•	Purpose: Manage interactions between game elements.
•	Details:
o	Player bullet vs. enemy: Increment score and remove enemy/bullet.
o	Enemy bullet vs. player: Decrease player lives and remove bullet.
o	Use algorithms optimized for collision detection:
	Iterate through vectors of bullets and enemies.
	Check intersections using bounding boxes (sf::FloatRect).
6. Game State Updates:
•	Purpose: Manage game progression, score, and lives.
•	Details:
o	Update score:
	Increment by predefined points (e.g., 10 points per enemy).
o	Update High Score
	As the score progress
o	Update lives:
	Decrease when the player gets hit.
	If lives reach zero, set the Game Over flag.
7.level up:
•	Purpose: to increase user experience and difficulty
•	Details:
o	When user clear the first level 
8.Game Over Handling:
•	Purpose: Stop the game and display the final score.
•	Details:
o	Check if player lives reach 0.
o	Pause the game loop.
o	Display "Game Over" and final score using sf::Text.

Algorithms and Data Structures:

1.	Data Structures:
o	Vectors:
	Store bullets for both player and enemies (std::vector<sf::CircleShape>).
	Maintain dynamic entities (e.g., active enemies or bullets).
o	sf::FloatRect:
	Used for boundary enforcement and collision detection.
o	sf::Text:
	Used to display the score, lives, and "Game Over" message.
2.	Collision Detection Algorithm:
o	Iterate through each player bullet and check for collisions with all active enemies using bounding box checks (sf::FloatRect::intersects()).
o	Iterate through each enemy bullet and check for collisions with the player.
3.	Random Enemy Movement:
o	Use std::rand() or std::uniform_int_distribution to generate random directions or speeds for enemies.
o	Ensure they stay within boundaries.

4.	Game Loop Logic:
o	Standard SFML game loop:
while (window.isOpen()) {
handleInput();   // Process player input
updateEntities(); // Update positions, collisions, score
render();        // Draw everything on screen
}
